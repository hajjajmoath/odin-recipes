    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>With our secret to fluffy scrambled eggs, you'll never have to worry about making burnt eggs ever again. And once you're through making these fluffy eggs, top them with the herb of your choice.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk eggs with salt until completely combined and very foamy.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a skillet over low heat until bubbling. Add whisked eggs; cook, stirring frequently for even, moist curds, until thickened and creamy, but still shiny, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove scrambled eggs from the pan before they begin to look dry, as they will continue to thicken off the heat.</li>
    </ol>
